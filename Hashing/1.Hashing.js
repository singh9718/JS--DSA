// hashing is mainly used to implement the dictonaries where we have key-value pairs.
// it is also used to implement sets where we have only keys.

// provide search, insert, delete all three operations in O(1) time on average
// in hashing all the values are unique
// it search exact key words.

// not useful for: 
//  1.finding closest value
//  2.sorted data
//  3.prefix searching

// for 1 and 2, AVL Tree or Red Blacl Tree is used.
// for 3, Trie DS is used




// Application of Hashing, most used DS after Array..
// 1. 




// Direct Address Table

// DAT is a data structure that has the capability of mapping records to their corresponding keys using arrays.
// In DAT, records are placed using their key values directly as indexes. They facilitate fast searching, insertion and deletion operations.
